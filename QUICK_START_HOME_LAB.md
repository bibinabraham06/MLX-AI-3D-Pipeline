# 🚀 Quick Start: MLX + Home Lab Integration

## 🎯 **Best Practice Summary**

Based on your current setup, here's the **optimal approach**:

### **🏆 Recommended Architecture:**

**🖥️ MacBook Pro M4 (Local MLX):**
- ⚡ **Real-time work**: Texture generation, 3D pipeline, interactive tasks
- 📦 **Models**: Small-medium MLX models (4-8B parameters)
- 🎯 **Use cases**: Blender integration, rapid prototyping, voice control

**🏠 Home Lab (Ollama Server):**
- 🧠 **Heavy processing**: Complex reasoning, large-scale generation
- 📦 **Models**: Large models (13B-70B parameters)
- 🎯 **Use cases**: Batch processing, advanced coding, research tasks

## ⚡ **Quick Setup (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Start Home Lab Services**
```bash
# Run the automated setup
cd ~/Projects/MLX
./setup_home_lab_models.sh
```

### **Step 2: Download Essential Models**

**Local MLX (Automatic on first use):**
- `mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit`
- `mlx-community/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0-4bit`
- `mlx-community/CodeLlama-7B-Instruct-4bit`

**Home Lab (Automatic download):**
- `llama3.1:8b` (fast general use)
- `mistral:7b` (efficient reasoning)
- `codellama:7b` (code generation)

### **Step 3: Test the Setup**
```bash
# Test local MLX 3D pipeline
./ai_3d_pipeline.sh quick "test texture"

# Test home lab connection
curl http://100.75.230.110:11434/api/tags
```

---

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **🎨 Real-Time Creative Work (Local):**
```bash
# Generate textures instantly
./ai_3d_pipeline.sh quick "metal surface"

# Full 3D pipeline with Blender
./ai_3d_pipeline.sh full "ancient stone wall" --object cube
```

### **🧠 Complex Tasks (Home Lab):**
```bash
# Set home lab as default
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://100.75.230.110:11434"

# Use large models for complex reasoning
ollama run llama3.1:70b "Design a complete software architecture"

# Advanced code generation
ollama run codellama:34b "Write a complete REST API with authentication"
```

### **🔄 Hybrid Workflows:**
```bash
# Start with local for speed, use home lab for complexity
# 1. Generate concept locally
./ai_3d_pipeline.sh quick "spaceship texture"

# 2. Enhance with home lab processing
ollama run llama3.1:70b "Improve this 3D model concept with advanced materials"

# 3. Apply back to Blender locally
./ai_3d_pipeline.sh full "enhanced spaceship design" --object sphere
```

## 📊 **Performance Expectations**

| Task | Location | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Texture Generation | Local MLX | <5 sec | High |
| 3D Model Creation | Local MLX | <10 sec | High |
| Code Generation | Local MLX | <3 sec | Good |
| Complex Reasoning | Home Lab | <30 sec | Excellent |
| Large Image Gen | Home Lab | <60 sec | Excellent |
| Batch Processing | Home Lab | Background | Excellent |

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Home Lab Not Responding:**
```bash
# Check Tailscale connectivity
tailscale status | grep ollama

# Test direct connection
ping 100.75.230.110

# Restart Ollama (if accessible)
ssh root@100.75.230.110 "systemctl restart ollama"
```

### **If Local MLX Issues:**
```bash
# Check MLX installation
cd ~/Projects/MLX
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "import mlx.core as mx; print('MLX OK')"

# Reinstall if needed
pip install --upgrade mlx mlx-lm
```
